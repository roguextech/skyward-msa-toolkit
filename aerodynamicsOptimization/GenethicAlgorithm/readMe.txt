# aerodynamicsOptimization

This code implements an aerodynamics optimization of the rocket.

The optimization variables are the fin chords and heigth, the fin shape,    
the ogive length and the ogive shape.

The code uses the genetic algorithm to reach the aim. It takes few hours to run, be patient.


# Usage

The variables range and other features can be set in the script configOptimization.
The quantities are integer, to run faster, without a big loss of optimization.
You need just to set some variables in the config  like the wind maximum 
magnitude or the minimum wanted stability margin.

the other quantities needed are stored in the simulationData script.
